Working on a personal website is a project I always get excited about. Not only do I get the chance to put into practice what I have learned since the last iteration, but I also get to actually visualise my evolution over the years.
This project is my 2022 take on my personal website.


## Run locally
(1) Make sure you install all the necessary dependencies:
`npm i`

(2) Run the project locally:
`npm run dev`

## Netlify
This project is linked with Netlify - where the website is hosted. Everytime there is a change on the main branch, Netflify will automatically trigger a re-deploy.
To make sure everything runs smoothly, make sure to run `npm run build` before commiting to the `main` branch.

## Technologies used:
- React
- Typescript
- SCSS
